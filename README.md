# algorithms_unlocked

These files are a collection of the algorithms that were written in pseudocode by Thomas Cormen in
his book "Algorithms Unlocked". I believe I've managed to transcribe them into Python. I highly 
recommend Cormen's book. It is extremely well written and easy to read (In other words, it won't make 
you accidently take a snooze when you're trying too hard to really absorb the material.)

Some other books I've got on my reading to either read completely through review what's in them
include:


Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein

The Quick Python Book by Ceder

Beginning Linux Programming by Matthew and Stones

The Linux Programmer's Guide by Goldt, van der Meer, Burkett, and Welsh  

Eloquent JavaScript by Haverbeke
