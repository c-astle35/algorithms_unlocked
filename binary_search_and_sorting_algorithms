---BINARY SEARCH---
Let's say you have a phone book with all the names sorted in it alphabetically. Conducting a binary
search, you first find the middle page and you ask yourself: "Is the name I'm looking for go before
this page or after this, or is the name I'm looking for already on this page?" By doing so, you then
can either end your search there or cut the number of items you need to look by half. Then depending
on your answer to the first question, you then either stop because you have found the word or you go
to one of the respective and then go to the middle page of that section and ask youself the same
question again. 

Because the number of items you're looking is constantly being in cut in half, we can say that binary 
search has a running time of O(log n). Note that in computer science lg refers to base log base two.

Think about this way: 
Let's say we're visually all the possible paths were willing to take by asking ourselves the same 
question we mentioned earlier without ever finding the value we're looking for. Our first decision 
will have to be between the left and right path (two options). Extending this idea further, let's say
that each of those paths will then have two options ad infinitum. If we are to see the options grouped
by levels, we can then say that each one of those levels is then an action to be made which equates to
the n we're looking for in computer science.

Binary Tree:

        3                 Notice the levels. When you've reached anyone of the level three
      /                   decisions, that means you've have to had made three actions though
    2                     may vary accordingly. 
  /   \ 
 /      3                 Thus we can write that the running time for a binary-search algorithm is
1                         O(lg n). Note that lg uses base two in computer science. So we can write 
 \      3                 that runtime for this particular instance of a binary search algorithm 
  \   /                   was O(lg 8) = 3 were n = the number of elements in the array. Also, note
    2                     binary search algorithms only run really well when dealing with arrays
      \                   that have been sorted.
